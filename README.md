# QuilFX

If you want to use the basic Quil, you should go here: https://github.com/quil/quil.

But if you want to integrate a quil animation within a javafx frame, then you
are at the right place.

This version of quil, is like the normal quil but instead of using standard
processing (https://github.com/processing/processing), it uses
https://github.com/Piervit/processing3-javafx which allow to embed processing
sketch within javafx frame.
